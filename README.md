# InfiniteTalk for RunPod Serverless
[한국어 README 보기](README_kr.md)

This project is a template designed to easily deploy and use [InfiniteTalk](https://github.com/Kijai/InfiniteTalk) in the RunPod Serverless environment.

[![Runpod](https://api.runpod.io/badge/wlsdml1114/InfiniteTalk_Runpod_hub)](https://console.runpod.io/hub/wlsdml1114/InfiniteTalk_Runpod_hub)

InfiniteTalk is an AI model that takes a single portrait image and speech audio as input to generate natural lip-sync videos with infinite talking capabilities.

## 🎨 Engui Studio Integration

[![EnguiStudio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wlsdml1114/Engui_Studio/main/assets/banner.png)](https://github.com/wlsdml1114/Engui_Studio)

This InfiniteTalk template is primarily designed for **Engui Studio**, a comprehensive AI model management platform. While it can be used via API, Engui Studio provides enhanced features and broader model support.

**Engui Studio Benefits:**
- **Expanded Model Support**: Access to a wider variety of AI models beyond what's available through API
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Intuitive workflow management and model selection
- **Advanced Features**: Additional tools and capabilities for AI model deployment
- **Seamless Integration**: Optimized for Engui Studio's ecosystem

> **Note**: While this template works perfectly with API calls, Engui Studio users will have access to additional models and features that are planned for future releases.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Infinite Talking**: Generates continuous talking videos without limitations on duration.
*   **High-Quality Lip-sync**: Lip movements are precisely synchronized with the input audio.
*   **Real-time Video Generation**: Creates videos synchronized with input audio at high speed.
*   **ComfyUI Integration**: Built on top of ComfyUI for flexible workflow management.
*   **Multiple Workflow Support**: Supports both Image-to-Video (I2V) and Video-to-Video (V2V) workflows.
*   **Single & Multi-Person**: Handles both single-person and multi-person talking scenarios.

## 🚀 RunPod Serverless Template

This template includes all the necessary components to run InfiniteTalk as a RunPod Serverless Worker.

*   **Dockerfile**: Configures the environment and installs all dependencies required for model execution.
*   **handler.py**: Implements the handler function that processes requests for RunPod Serverless.
*   **entrypoint.sh**: Performs initialization tasks when the worker starts.
*   **I2V_single.json**: Image-to-Video single-person workflow configuration.
*   **I2V_multi.json**: Image-to-Video multi-person workflow configuration.
*   **V2V_single.json**: Video-to-Video single-person workflow configuration.
*   **V2V_multi.json**: Video-to-Video multi-person workflow configuration.

### Output

#### Success

If the job is successful, it returns a JSON object with the generated video. The response format depends on the `network_volume` parameter.

**When `network_volume` is `false` (default):**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video` | `string` | Base64 encoded video file data. |

**Success Response Example (Base64):**

```json
{
  "video": "data:video/mp4;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNkYPhfDwAChwGA60e6kgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
}
```

**When `network_volume` is `true`:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video_path` | `string` | File path to the generated video stored in the network volume. |

**Success Response Example (Network Volume):**

```json
{
  "video_path": "/runpod-volume/infinitetalk_task_12345.mp4"
}
```

#### Error

If the job fails, it returns a JSON object containing an error message.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `error` | `string` | Description of the error that occurred. |

**Error Response Example:**

```json
{
  "error": "비디오를 찾을 수 없습니다."

## 🛠️ Usage and API Reference

1.  Create a Serverless Endpoint on RunPod based on this repository.
2.  Once the build is complete and the endpoint is active, submit jobs via HTTP POST requests according to the API Reference below.

### 📁 Using Network Volumes

You can use RunPod's Network Volumes for both input and output files. This is especially useful when dealing with large files.

#### For Input Files

Instead of directly transmitting Base64 encoded files, you can use Network Volumes to handle large input files:

1.  **Create and Connect Network Volume**: Create a Network Volume (e.g., S3-based volume) from the RunPod dashboard and connect it to your Serverless Endpoint settings.
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload the image, video, and audio files you want to use to the created Network Volume.
3.  **Specify Paths**: When making an API request, specify the file paths within the Network Volume for `image_path`, `video_path`, and `wav_path`. For example, if the volume is mounted at `/my_volume` and you use `portrait.jpg`, the path would be `"/my_volume/portrait.jpg"`.

#### For Output Files

You can also use Network Volumes to store the generated video files instead of returning Base64 data:

1.  **Set `network_volume` to `true`**: Add `"network_volume": true` to your request input.
2.  **Get File Path**: The response will contain a `video_path` field with the location of the generated video file in the network volume.
3.  **Access Files**: The generated video will be saved to `/runpod-volume/` directory with a unique filename.

**Benefits of using Network Volumes:**
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: No need to load large files into memory for Base64 encoding/decoding
- **Faster Processing**: Direct file access is more efficient than Base64 conversion
- **Persistent Storage**: Generated files remain accessible after the job completes
- **Large File Support**: Handle files larger than typical API payload limits

## 🔧 Workflow Configuration

This template includes four workflow configurations that are automatically selected based on your input parameters:

*   **I2V_single.json**: Image-to-Video single-person workflow
*   **I2V_multi.json**: Image-to-Video multi-person workflow
*   **V2V_single.json**: Video-to-Video single-person workflow
*   **V2V_multi.json**: Video-to-Video multi-person workflow

### Workflow Selection Logic

The handler automatically selects the appropriate workflow based on your input parameters:

| input_type | person_count | Selected Workflow |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `"image"` | `"single"` | I2V_single.json |
| `"image"` | `"multi"` | I2V_multi.json |
| `"video"` | `"single"` | V2V_single.json |
| `"video"` | `"multi"` | V2V_multi.json |

The workflows are based on ComfyUI and include all necessary nodes for InfiniteTalk processing. Each workflow is optimized for its specific use case and includes the appropriate model configurations.
